## Algorithm Interview Questions - Javascript Implementation : Palindrome

### DIFFICULTY : n/5, n âˆˆ [1, 2]

### Problem definition
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
The next number in the sequence is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

* ___Given n = 2____, the result is found by adding the two numbers before it ___(1+1)____
* ___Given n = 3___, the result is found by adding the two numbers before it ___(1+2)___,
* ___Give n = 5___, the result is found this way => ____fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(3)____

:exclamation: and so on :smile:

### Tasks

Propose one or two algorithms, given a number n, which return the next number in the fibonacci sequence.

### Tips

1. Use your maths knowledge
2. Use a paper and pen to visualize the problem
3. For this problem it's better to write a mathematical function

### Recommendations
Do not rush in the algorithm first, take your time and breathe :) 

### The following test cases should pass

| n = | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|fibonacci(n) = | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 55 | 89 | 144 | 233 | 377 |
