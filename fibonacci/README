## Algorithm Interview Questions - Javascript Implementation : Palindrome

### DIFFICULTY : n/5, n âˆˆ [1, 2]

### Problem definition
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
The next number in the sequence is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Given n = 2, the result is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
Given n = 3, the result is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
Give n= 5, the result is found this way => fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(3)
and so on!

### Tasks

Propose one or two algorithms, given a number n, which return the next number in the fibonacci sequence.

### Tips

1. Use your maths knowledge
2. Use a paper and pen to visualize the problem
3. For this problem it's better to write a mathematical function

### Recommendations
Do not rush in the algorithm first, take your time and breathe :) 

### The following test cases should pass
