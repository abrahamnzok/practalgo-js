## Algorithm Interview Questions - Javascript Implementation : Palindrome

### DIFFICULTY : n/5, n âˆˆ [1, 3]

### Problem definition
A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run.

### Tasks
Write one or two algorithm solutions which determines if a word, phrase or sequence is a palindrome.

### Tips

1. When comparing strings, make sure they are either in uppercase or lowercase
2. You can go for the straightforward solution first by creating the reversed string.

### Recommendations

You should write your own palindrome algorithm and test its complexity. 

### The following test cases should pass

Given these strings : 'madam', 'radar', 'Anna', 'Kayak', 'Sagas', 'Don't nod', 'Red rum, sir, is murder
', 'No lemon, no melon', 'nurses run'

Your function has to return true if a word or sequence is a palindrome.
