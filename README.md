### 1. Why this project :question:

There are good developers out there with great knowledge, and I strongly believe in sharing that knowledge.

Today platforms such as [codesignal](https://app.codesignal.com/) give the ability to practise and to challenge oneself on solving  algorithms. 

Such platforms are great but not always, because: 
  1. There is no explanation given as to the implementation of the algorithms.
  2. You cannot navigate in the different exercises

### 2. Purpose

The aim of this project is to give as much as possible algorithms exercises to practise problem solving. For instance, in order for junior developers to practise for their technical interviews. 

Not only that, it can be also be a great place for developers to learn, practise, or see how an algorithm can be used to solve a problem.

More importantly, it is great to share knowledge, especially in a world such as IT. For that reason, This project is opened to any developer who can share an algorithm, its implementation and give an explanation.

In a ideal world, it would be best to have implementations in the following programming languages:

* Java
* Javascript/Typescript
* Ruby
* Python
* Scala
* Erlang 
* Or any other popular programming language 

A long term vision would be to have multi-repositories and publish a book in the programming languages mentioned above.

### 3. How it should be used 

#### a. By developers 

Developers are welcomed to submit algorithm exercises and their implementations. Each exercise must have a readme with the following information : 

 * The title and the language used to implement the exercise
 * The level of difficulty, e.g : ___n/5, n âˆˆ [1, 2]___
 * The problem definition/description
 * Tasks
 * Tips to aid the understanding of the problem
 * Recommendations
 * Test cases to be fulfilled
 
 Developers can give several implementations but have to make sure to separate the concerns.
 
 Developers can give the optimum solution but are not required to. This task falls upon the interviewees.
 
#### b. By Interviewees

The interviewees are also developers/future developers. They can practise for their technical interviews by exploring the different exercises made available through this project.

On the other hand, an interviewee can also submit pull request and participate in the evolution of this project. 

#### c. By recruiters

Recruiters are welcomed to pick some exercises for their interviewees. 

Recruiters should take in account both the level of difficulty and the level of the developers they are interviewing.

#### d. Submitting an implementation

In order to submit an implementation, the developer/interviewee must create a file with the following format : `solution_identifier.js`, in the exercise's directory. :exclamation: `identifier is the following file's number, for instance solution_3.js`

:exclamation: Before submitting make sure the tests cases are fulfilled
