### 1. Purpose

The aim of this project is to give as much as possible algorithm exercises to practise problem solving and share knowledge, from experienced developers to junior developers, in order for junior developers to practise for their technical interviews.

Not only that, it can be also be a great place for developers where they can learn, practise, or see how a problem can be solved.

In fact, most common problems in the IT industry involve algorithm implementations. 

More importantly, it is important to share knowledge, especially in a world such as IT. For that reason, This project is opened to any developer who can share an algorithm and its implementation.

In a ideal world, it would be best to have implementations in the following programming languages:

* Java
* Javascript/Typescript
* Ruby
* Python
* Scala
* Erlang 
* Or any other popular programming language 

### 2. How it should be used 

#### a. By developers 

<img src="assets/programmer.png" width="50%">

Developers are welcomed to submit algorithm exercices and their implementations. Each exercise must have a readme with the following information : 

 * The title and the language used to implement the exercise
 * The level of difficulty, e.g : ___n/5, n âˆˆ [1, 2]___
 * The problem definition/description
 * Tasks
 * Tips to aid the understanding of the problem
 * Recommendations
 * Test cases to be fulfilled
 
 Developers can give several implementations but have to make sure to separate the concerns.
 
 Developers can give the optimum solution but are not required to. This task falls upon the interviewees.
 
#### b. By Interviewees

The interviewees are also developers/future developers. They can practise for their technical interviews by exploring the different exercises made available through this project.

On the other hand, an interviewee can also submit pull request and participate in the evolution of this project. 

In order to submit an implementation, the interviewee must create a file with the following format : `solution_githubusername.js`, in the exercise's directory.

:exclamation: Before submitting make sure the tests cases are fulfilled

#### c. By recruiters

Recruiters are welcomed to pick some exercises for their interviewees. 

Recruiters should take in account both the level of difficulty and the level of the developers they are interviewing.
