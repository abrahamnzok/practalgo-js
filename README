##Common/Useful Algorithm Implementations Exercises

###Purpose

The aim of this project is to give as much as possible algorithm exercises to practise problem solving and share knowledge, from experienced developers to junior developers, in order for junior developers to practise for their technical interviews.

Not only that, it can be also be a great place for developers where they can learn, practise, or see how a problem can be solved.

In fact, most common problems in the IT industry involve algorithm implementations. 

More importantly, it is important to share knowledge, especially in a world such as IT. For that reason, This project is opened to any developer who can share an algorithm and its implementation.

In a ideal world, it would be best to have implementations in the following programming languages:

* Java
* Javascript/Typescript
* Ruby
* Python
* Scala
* Erlang 
* Or any other popular programming language 

##How it should work 

####For developers

####For Interviewees

####For recruiters

For each exercise, there is a description of the problem and its level of difficulty.
